# Console-Based Toll Booth Simulation (C++)

## Description
This project is a simple console-based application written in C++ to simulate a toll booth system. 
It was built to understand and apply core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Features
- Supports multiple vehicle types (Car, Truck, Bike)
- Calculates toll based on vehicle type
- Displays total toll collection and vehicle details
- Menu-driven user input

## OOP Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation and Data Hiding
- Abstraction using abstract base class
- Inheritance
- Runtime Polymorphism
- Constructors and Virtual Destructors
- Access Modifiers (private, protected, public)

## Technologies Used
- Language: C++
- Concepts: OOPS, STL (vector)

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   g++ toll_booth.cpp -o toll_booth
2. Run the executable:
   ./toll_booth

## Note
This project is a learning-focused implementation and not intended for production use.
